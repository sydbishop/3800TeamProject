        <h2>The Origins of Chess</h2>
        <p>6th Century - 15th Century:
            </br> Chess, a game of strategic brilliance and intellectual prowess, traces its roots to ancient India in the form of "chaturanga." Originating in the 6th century, this early version of chess featured pieces representing infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. The game's evolution was marked by the migration of ideas, as it made its way to Persia and transformed into "shatranj," gaining popularity in the Islamic world.

        <p>7th Century - 10th Century:
            </br>Chess found fertile ground in the Islamic world between the 7th and 10th centuries. The game, now known as "shatranj," became a favored pastime among scholars and nobility. Islamic scholars played a crucial role in refining the rules, setting the stage for chess to become a cultural phenomenon beyond its Indian origins.
