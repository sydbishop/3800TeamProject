    <h3>Step 1: How To Setup The Chessboard</h3>
    <p>
      Every player starts with the white (or light) color square in the bottom
      right-hand square of the chessboard.

      The chess pieces are then always placed in the same configuration. There
      are pawns in the second row (or rank). The rooks go in the corners,
      followed by the knights beside them, the bishops, and lastly the queen,
      who always goes on her corresponding color (black queen on black, white
      queen on white), with the king going on the last square.

    <h3>Step 2: How The Chess Pieces Move</h3>
    <p>
      Every one of the six types of pieces moves in a unique way. Pieces are
      never allowed to move onto a square that contains one of their own pieces,
      nor can they pass through other pieces (although the knight can leap over
      other pieces). They can, however, be moved to replace a piece that an
      opponent has captured after it has been moved. Generally, pieces are
      placed so they can control key squares in the game, defend themselves
      against capture, or capture other pieces by landing on their square and
      then replacing them.

    <p>
      Every time, the player using the white pieces moves first. Therefore, in
      most games, the decision of who gets to be white is made by chance or
      happenstance, such as when a coin is flipped or a player is asked to guess
      the color of a hidden pawn in the other player's hand. After that, until
      the game is over, white moves first, then black, then white again, and so
      on. The small advantage of being able to move first allows the white
      player to launch an immediate attack.
